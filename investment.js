//  A company invests its money in N projects (numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1). The K-th project has a dedicated bank account number A[K]. The first two characters of the account number are capital letters and represent the country code; the next six characters are digits.

// The company invests B[K] in the K-th project. Which country's projects receive the most investment?

// Write a function:

// function solution(A, B);

// that, given an array A consisting of N strings representing account numbers and an array B consisting of N integers representing investments, returns a string specifying the country code of the country that receives the most investment. If there are many possible answers, choose any of them.

// Examples:

// Given A = ["GB402342", "GB132491", "PL132048"] and B = [2, 2, 5], the function should return "PL".
// Given A = ["CC000000", "AB000000", "CC444444", "DD000000"] and B = [7, 10, 5, 8], the function should return "CC".
// Given A = ["FR123456", "US987654"] and B = [12, 12], the function should return either "FR" or "US".
// Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

// N is an integer within the range [1..200,000];
// each element of array B is an integer within the range [1..10,000];
// each account number consists of eight characters (the first two are uppercase letters; the others are digits) and is unique.
